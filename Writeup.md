##Writeup
Rails Girls meetup is an avenue to introduce women to the wonderful language of Ruby and the awesome framework, Ruby on Rails. 

Learning how to program might seem daunting (it really isn't) but don't worry, we are here to help you along.

Instead of a fixed curriculum delivered classroom-style, Rails Girls meetup gives you the flexibility to choose what you want to do. There will be coaches around to answer any problems you have.

If you have no idea where to start, we'll guide you through that too!

(And yes, everything is hands-on.)



Here are some suggestions of what you can choose to do:

1. Install Rails in your computer

2. Continue with your work on the Rails Girls app and perhaps follow some of the additional guides on http://guides.railsgirls.com/app/,

3. Do the RailsBridge curriculum  
at http://docs.railsbridge.org/intro-to-rails/

4. Work on your own project/learning material

Please choose one of the options above when you RVSP.
